Weekend Movie Saga Johnny
Description
Duration: One Weekend

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

With this app, the main objective was making a movie list that when clicking on an image will take you to the page of the image you clicked on to see the descriptions. The other objective was to add a movie with a movie name, image url, and a description. How this was solved as using saga functions in the index.js, setting up router inputs to store the information on a database, and making the different pages that pull down information on specific movies. By using a map function to get and push the data the user has either added or gotten we solved this problem.
